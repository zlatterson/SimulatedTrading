## Brief
Create a restful API from scratch using Java Spring and implement in a front end web application using React which will allow the users to view the formatted data and get access to the open API for their own usage. 
The theme of the API/Application will be recipes for drinks.
### MVP
For the MVP the user should be able to:
- Have a starting amount of cash
- Have a portfolio of positions.
- Add to their portfolio by searching for a stock, buying for current market price.
- Sell stock from their portfolio
- Track performance

### Continuous Improvement
- Deploy app
- Allow the user to use leverage such as: buy Call/Put contracts
- Allow the user to make positions over twitter
- Track twitter users performances with scraping

Use the following frameworks / libraries:
- Auth0 for authenticating API requests.
